Craftworx features many changes in gameplay from vanilla 7 Days to Die, which up until now haven’t been as obvious to the players as I’d thought when I started making it. Clearly, this situation needs to change, which is why I’ve created this guide to the mod. Hopefully this will clear up many of the misconceptions and misunderstandings that exist.


Gameplay Changes

The first big change is obviously the interface itself. Craftworx uses a modified version of Sirillion’s SMX HUD, which puts more information on the main screen. The level display is a circle rather than a line, and is displayed in the upper left corner with the day and time.

</p>

The compass features a graphic marker for the center point, making it easier to tell which direction your character is facing.

</p>

The health and stamina displays are now grouped with meters which show food and water status, along with a count of zombie kills, current elevation, ambient temperature, and character temperature.

</p>

Character advancement is somewhat slower than the vanilla game, which is balanced out by providing 8 skill points per level instead of the vanilla 6. 

Using fireaxes now uses a different skill, carpentry, rather than mining, as does crafting pretty much anything made from wood.

</p>

Crafting steel arrows and bolts can now only be done at the workbench, and requires the fletching jig; additionally, the recipe for the basic steel arrows and bolts has changed from arrowhead, feather and wood to scrap plastic (for the fletching), wood, arrowhead, and glue (for attaching the fletching to the shaft). 
<p align="center">

</p>
This makes harvesting bones much more important than before, since this makes glue a much more valuable resource. Keep in mind that it is possible to upgrade existing stone arrows and iron arrows and bolts to steel arrows just using steel arrowheads and the other kinds, which means that it is still possible to craft steel arrows and bolt without the glue, just more time-consuming, and still requires the use of the fletching jig. The fletching jig can be crafted at the workbench with the second level of the advanced tooling perk.

</p>

Crafting ammunition requires calipers (craftable in the forge), and can only be done at the workbench.
<p align="center">

Crafting metal armor requires the drill press (craftable at the workbench with the second level of Advanced Tooling), and can only be done at the workbench.
<p align="center">

</p>

Crafting the forge now requires the first level of the Advanced Tooling perk, which also unlocks the workbench. Each additional level of Advanced Tooling unlocks specific items; level two unlocks the fletching jig and drill press, and level three unlocks the working sink and electric oven.

</p>

Crafting clothing now advances the Tailoring skill. Certain items of clothing can’t be repaired at the start of the game, because the recipes are now tied to the perk Tinker, Tailor, Etc., and are therefore not available for crafting until the appropriate level has been unlocked. This means that brown versions of clothing (like brown shorts, or brown sweatshirt) can’t be crafted or repaired until the skill has been learned.

</p>

Crafting bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts are now handled by the fletching skill, rather than weapon smithing.
<p align="center">

</p>

The hunting rifle and the AK now have scoped versions. The scoped parts are created by making the rifle scope in the forge, then crafting the scoped parts using the appropriate weapon parts (hunting rifle or AK). When assembling the weapon, you can choose which version you wish to make. The scoped hunting rifle magazine now holds three cartridges instead of one.

Suppressed versions of firearms (excluding shotguns and the blunderbuss) can be crafted by learning the Silent But Deadly perk. Each of the five levels unlocks a version of suppressed weapons, starting with pistols, followed by the hunting rifle, MP5 SMG, AK, and finally the sniper rifle.

</p>

Crafting specific types of clothing is now available through the Tinker, Tailor, Etc., perk, which unlocks various types of clothing in each of the current five levels (more levels may be added in later versions of Craftworx). Starting at level one, you can craft shirts and t-shirts, followed by pants, overalls and shorts at level two, sweatshirts (hooded and not) and flannel shirts at level three, black leather duster and black cowboy hat at level four, and goth pants and boots at level five.

</p>

The rocket launcher, poop mortar cannon, and flamethrower are now handled by the heavy weapons skill instead of guns.
<p align="center">
  <img width="656" height="569" src="https://i.imgur.com/1aM0aE7.jpg">
</p>

The flamethrower recipe is now gained by learning the first level of the Gun Bunny perk, which also increases the damage dealt by heavy weapons.

-----Installation-----

--- BACK UP YOUR CONFIG FILES BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES WITH THIS MOD ---

In order to play nicely with the 7D2D Mod Launcher, the mod is set up with the correct folder structure to put files where the need to be to run the game properly. Installing this mod is a great deal easier as a result. Simply unpack the archive and copy the contents of Craftworx-master into your \Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\, and the files will go where they need to go.

I do strongly recommend using the 7D2D Mod Launcher, as it makes keeping your game updated a great deal easier.

Please be aware that if the game updates, this will overwrite this mod, and you will have to reinstall it.

--- Servers ---

Craftworx was designed for use in single-player games, so running this mod on a server may present some difficulties I haven't foreseen. If your players are missing the icons from this mod, have them download the icon pack; extract the archive and copy the \Mods folder to their 7 Days to Die folder. Of course, you can avoid some of these problems by using the 7D2D Mod Launcher...
