--- About This Mod ---

Craftworx compatible with Alpha 15

Current version: Craftworx 1.1

This is a complete overhaul of LathMod, which itself was an overhaul mod for 7 Days to Die. Craftworx is a mod aimed more at folks who enjoy crafting, which means that the crafting skills are more defined than vanilla. Harvesting wood now falls under the Carpentry skill, rather than mining, as do crafting most wood objects in the game. Bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts are now crated in the Fletching skill, rather than Weapon Smithing. There are also perks and skills which add more ammunition, allow crafting of different kinds of clothing, and more.

Advancing in crafting takes a bit longer than in vanilla, as the skill levels for concrete, steel, and Advanced Tooling (which replaces workbench and also locks the forge) have been raised from vanilla levels. Craftworx adds suppressed firearms, iron bows and crossbows, and a few other new weapons, as well as new weapons perks.

Craftworx features a custom HUD created by Sirillion (with minor modifications), Stallionsden's Backpack Expansion, Valmar's Expanded Traps (modified), a flamethrower from Andy of Andy's Mods (originally for A12 but updated to A15), and SylenThunder's Lighted Glass Blocks (updated from A13). Credit for those parts of this mod goes to them.

-----Installation-----

--- BACK UP YOUR CONFIG FILES BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES WITH THIS MOD ---

In order to play nicely with the 7D2D Mod Launcher, the mod is set up with the correct folder structure to put files where the need to be to run the game properly. Installing this mod is a great deal easier as a result. Simply unpack the archive and copy the contents of Craftworx-master into your \Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\, and the files will go where they need to go.

I do strongly recommend using the 7D2D Mod Launcher, as it makes keeping your game updated a great deal easier.

Please be aware that if the game updates, this will overwrite this mod, and you will have to reinstall it.

--- Servers ---

Craftworx was designed for use in single-player games, so running this mod on a server may present some difficulties I haven't foreseen. If your players are missing the icons from this mod, have them download the icon pack; extract the archive and copy the \Mods folder to their 7 Days to Die folder. In the case of the expanded backpack, please visit the Backpack Expansion  thread to download the 75-slot backpack dedicated DLL file. Of course, you can avoid some of these problems by using the 7D2D Mod Launcher...
