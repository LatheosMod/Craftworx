There is now a wiki for Craftworx, located within the Github repository. It should help with understanding the differences between this mod and the vanilla game. You can access it directly by following this link:

Craftworx features a modified Sirillion's SMX UI, modified LavenderJosh's Quality of Life and Firearms Improvement Mod, skullpoker's Deep Diving perk, Valmar's Working Ovens & Sinks, numberz's Expanded Minibike Storage, Katt's New Foods, three08's Third forge input slot, dretch's Junction Box, JaxTeller718's Junk Items - Golden Egg - Scrap Iron Shiv - Electrified Spiked Club. Credit for those parts of this mod goes to them. Additionally, Valmar, Sirillion and StompyNZ were extremely helpful in getting parts of this mod working properly, and Sphereii has been extremely helpful in getting Craftworx looking fantastic in the 7D2D Mod Launcher. Thanks, guys!

-----Installation-----

--- BACK UP YOUR CONFIG FILES BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES WITH THIS MOD ---

--- EAC MUST be disabled to play this mod ---

In order to play nicely with the 7D2D Mod Launcher, the mod is set up with the correct folder structure to put files where they need to be to run the game properly. Installing this mod is a great deal easier as a result. Simply unpack the archive and copy the contents of Craftworx-master into your \Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\, and the files will go where they need to go.

I do strongly recommend using the 7D2D Mod Launcher, as it makes keeping your game updated a great deal easier.

Please be aware that if the game updates, that will overwrite this mod, and you will have to reinstall it.

--- Servers ---

Craftworx was designed for use in single-player games, so running this mod on a server may present some difficulties I haven't foreseen. If your players are missing the icons from this mod, have them download the icon pack; extract the archive and copy the \Mods folder to their 7 Days to Die folder. In the case of the expanded backpack, the server admin needs to download the appropriate version of the 72-slot backpack, which can be found here:

There are more directions on setting up a dedicated server in that post.
