--- About This Mod ---

Craftworx is compatible with Alpha 16.3b12

Current version: Craftworx 2.0

I made a number of changes to CraftWorx in A16, removing a number of parts that are no longer necessary in the current build. I've removed all modified blocks (inclusding Valmar's traps), as I don't see them as necessary. I may later revisit the Fuel Log, depending on how whether it seems left out after playing the new version. Carpentry is back, but currently not attached to crafted wood block types, which may change later. Tailoring is also back, and set up in line with the other crafting skills using purchased point levels. Clothier has been renamed Tinker, Tailor, etc., and may later incorporate crafting leather clothing (it currently only covers the same cotton clothes as in A15).

Craftworx features a custom HUD created by adapting Sirillion's SMX UI, and a flamethrower from Andy of Andy's Mods (originally for A12 but updated to A16). Credit for those parts of this mod goes to them. Additionally, Valmar, Sirillion and StompyNZ were extremely helpful in getting parts of this mod working properly. Thanks, guys!

-----Installation-----

--- BACK UP YOUR CONFIG FILES BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES WITH THIS MOD ---

In order to play nicely with the 7D2D Mod Launcher, the mod is set up with the correct folder structure to put files where the need to be to run the game properly. Installing this mod is a great deal easier as a result. Simply unpack the archive and copy the contents of Craftworx-master into your \Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\, and the files will go where they need to go.

I do strongly recommend using the 7D2D Mod Launcher, as it makes keeping your game updated a great deal easier.

Please be aware that if the game updates, that will overwrite this mod, and you will have to reinstall it.

--- Servers ---

Craftworx was designed for use in single-player games, so running this mod on a server may present some difficulties I haven't foreseen. If your players are missing the icons from this mod, have them download the icon pack; extract the archive and copy the \Mods folder to their 7 Days to Die folder. In the case of the expanded backpack, please visit the Backpack Expansion  thread to download the 75-slot backpack dedicated DLL file. Of course, you can avoid some of these problems by using the 7D2D Mod Launcher...
